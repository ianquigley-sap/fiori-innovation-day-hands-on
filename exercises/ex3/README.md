#  Exercise 3 - Generate an SAP Fiori app using images and text


In this exercise, we will create an **SAP Fiori** application using a document that contains both text and images, so that the required application can be best described.


## Exercise 3.1 Uploading the business requirement document with images

In the explorer in SAP Business Application Studio, expand the **classical_transaction** folder and right click on the **multi_image_old_ui.md** file (1).  Then click on the **Open Preview** link (2).

You should then see a document that includes a mixture of text and images.  This document contains images from a classic transaction app and details what each of the sections in the object page should contain with a mixture of screenshots and text.

Similar to the previous exercises, click on the SAP Fiori tools icon to open the panel with the AI Project Accelerator displayed (you can close the **Application Modeler** and **Information** sections):

The text of the file will be populated into the text box.  Click **Generate** to start generating your application.  This will take some time.

## Exercise 3.2 Reviewing the generate application from a business requirement document with images

After generation completes, click on the **Preview** button to launch a preview of the generated application.

You may see a message in the terminal stating that the port is already in use (from previewing our application from the last exercise), click **Return/Enter** to use any other port for preview

A new browser tab should open with the generated application.
