#  Exercise 2 - Generate an SAP Fiori app from an image

In this exercise, we will create a number of SAP Fiori apps, but instead of using a text document as input, we will instead use images of the applications that we want to create.

## Exercise 2.1 Downloading the sample images into SAP Business Application Studio

From the menu select **View -> Command Palette**

Paste the repository link below into the input field and hit enter.

```
https://github.com/ianquigley-sap/ai-image-samples
```

Choose the projects folder for the repository location and click **OK**

### Enable Additional AI Features with Fiori Tools

this manual configuration step is only required in the current beta phase of the SAP Fiori AI tools features.

From the menu select **File -> Add Folder to Workspace...**

![Add Folder to Workspace](ex2img4a.png)

Select folder **/home/user/.fioritools** and press **Ok**.

Both folders should appear together in a workspace as shown below, which is required for some of the subsequent exercises to work properly.

## Exercise 2.2 Launching the SAP Fiori tools AI Project Accelerator with image input

Click on the **SAP Fiori** icon in the left hand side panel.\
Similar to exercise 1, ensure that the SAP Fiori tools panel is open with the AI Project Accelerator displayed (you can close the **Application Modeler** and **Information** sections):

Click on the **Load file** link

![image](ex2img6.png)

Select the **countries.jpg** file and click **OK**

![image](ex2img72.png)

A thumbnail of the image should appear in the input box.  Click **Generate** to start generate the application directly from the image.

The application will start generating, give it some time

## Exercise 2.3 Previewing the generated application

After generation, click on the **Preview** button to launch a preview of the generated application.  

![image](ex2img10.png)

You may see a message in the terminal stating that the port is already in use (from previewing our application from exercise 1), click **Return/Enter** to use any other port for preview

![image](ex2img11.png)

The application should launch in a new browser tab. Click **Go** to see the sample data that the AI has created.

![image](ex2img12.png)

Navigate back to the tab with SAP Business Application Studio, and click **Accept** to include this project into your workspace

If you get a dropdown with a selection please choose the ai-image-samples folder.

![image](ex2img132.png)

Click on the **Explorer** icon and you should have a new folder for the project entitled **ai-created-cap**
